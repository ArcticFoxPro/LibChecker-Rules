The philosophy of FlutterBoost is to use Flutter in a manner similar to Webview. Managing both Native and Flutter pages in an existing application is not an easy task. FlutterBoost assists in handling page mapping and transitions, allowing you to focus only on the page names and parameters, which are typically URLs.",
