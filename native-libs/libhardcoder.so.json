                "description": "Hardcoder is a communication solution between Android apps and the system, breaking through the problem that apps can only call system standard APIs and cannot directly call system underlying hardware resources, allowing Android apps and systems to communicate in real-time. Apps can fully schedule system resources such as CPU frequency, big and little cores, GPU frequency, etc., to improve app performance, and the system can obtain more information from the app side to provide various system resources more reasonably. Meanwhile, for functions lacking standard interface implementation in Android, apps and systems can also achieve model adaptation and function expansion through this framework.",
