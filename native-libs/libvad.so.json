                "description": "DUI is dedicated to building a user-centered free human-machine interaction system based on scene services, targeting the smart home, in-vehicle, robotics, WeChat, customer service, app, and other IoT fields. It supports the free invocation of various controls such as images, lists, music, and embedded web pages, providing highly customizable full-link technology from wake-up, voice recognition, semantic understanding to dialogue management, content output, and TTS broadcasting. Based on the 'cloud + end' overall implementation plan and comprehensive developer services, with dialogue (Dialog) as the core, it allows customization from voice language technology to dialogue management, skill services, and interactive interfaces. The complementary relationship between VUI (Voice User Interface) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) achieves a perfect combination of 'voice + touch'. It is well known that the entire voice interaction process involves major stages from sound acquisition, front-end signal processing, voice wake-up, voice recognition, semantic understanding, intelligent dialogue, resource invocation, reply content generation, action execution, to synthesized voice broadcasting. The DUI system supports the use of the entire full-link voice technology, as well as the independent use of certain stages such as voice wake-up or voice recognition, or the combined use of one or two stages.",
